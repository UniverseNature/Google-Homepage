# Google-Homepage

I have made a bootleg version of the Google Homepage in which none of the links work (too lazy), and the search bar does nothing (don't know SQL).

#Warning
This webpage uses alot of absolute positioning, so if you are on a phone, or have a ultra wide moniter, this website won't look proper.
